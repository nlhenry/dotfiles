# i3 Window Manager Setup
## Requirements
#### Working Desktop Environment or Window Manager. I will be using Xfce because it is minimal and includes essential packages built in. 
## Install i3 Window Manager
#### Use this command in the terminal:
```
sudo apt install i3
```
#### The i3 install will give you i3-wm, dunst, i3lock, i3status, and suckless-tools. If the packages do not install automatically for some reason, just install them manually using the command below.
```
sudo apt-get install i3-wm dunst i3lock i3status suckless-tools
```
#### Install some additional packages for further customization:
```
sudo apt-get install compton hsetroot rxvt-unicode xsel rofi fonts-noto fonts-mplus xsettingsd lxappearance scrot viewnior
```
## Launching i3
#### Logout your current session. Then login again with a i3 session.
